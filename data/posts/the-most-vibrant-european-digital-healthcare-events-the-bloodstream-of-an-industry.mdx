In the last decade, a staggering figure of $70B was raised in Health Innovation with the sector showing no signs of slowing down, registering in this last year of 2019 an investment that reached $13.7B.

From all over the world, exciting events are brought to us in different ways, shapes and forms. Conferences, congresses, fairs, symposiums (etc..) are very important communication channels for any industry, where it focuses on important trending themes. In digital healthcare specifically, themes such as AI and clinical data, epigenomics, personalized medicine, and mobile health dominate our days.

We consider these kinds of events the "bloodstream" of an industry and for that reason, we have compiled a list of 46 European Digital Healthcare events we found interesting to foster networking and to expand knowledge.
