COVID-19 is impacting health around the world and making us understand the value of data. Right now, health professionals are still unsure about the right treatments because there is little knowledge around the virus. Hopefully, in a few years, we'll know which treatments were helpful or not.

Now, health professionals and scientists need to access as much detailed information as they can to help treat patients. On the other side, in some cases we can be compromising the privacy of patient information.

In Aurora, we have been learning about HIPAA compliance to help our clients know how they should apply the regulations. We develop a HIPAA widget where you can check if you’re compliant or not, and compiled the main information and questions about it.

## 

**What’s HIPAA?**

The **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act** (HIPAA) is a law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996 to provide data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. So, if you’re an entity that handles, transmits, possesses or is responsible for health records, you must comply with HIPAA.

The act contains five titles:

* **Title I**: HIPAA Health Insurance Reform
* **Title II**: HIPAA Administrative Simplification
* **Title III**: HIPAA Tax-Related Health Provisions
* **Title IV**: Application and Enforcement of Group Health Plan Requirements
* **Title V**: Revenue Offsets.

**Title II** is an important one for tech companies and includes 5 elements:

* National Provider Identifier Standard
* Transactions and Code Sets Standard
* HIPAA Privacy Rule
* HIPAA Security Rule
* HIPAA Enforcement Rule
* HIPAA Omnibus Rule (added in 2013)

## Why HIPAA?

HIPAA was initially created to “improve the portability and accountability of health insurance coverage” for employees between jobs. The second goal was to combat waste, fraud and abuse in health insurance and healthcare delivery.

To the healthcare industry, HIPAA improved the efficiency and security of the protected health information, on the transition of the healthcare industry from paper to electronic records.

For patients, HIPAA ensures that healthcare organizations must protect their sensitive data. If they fail, there will be repercussions.

The rules

### **HIPAA Privacy Rule**

> Patient health information must be protected.

The Privacy Rule demands that appropriate safeguards should be implemented to protect the privacy of Personal Health Information. It also sets limits and conditions on the use and disclosure of that information without patient authorization.

The rule also gives patients (or their nominated representatives) rights over their health information, including the right to obtain a copy of their health records or examine them. Covered entities must answer patient requests within 30 days.

### **HIPAA Security Rule**

Security Rule contains the standards that must be applied to safeguard and protect electronic personal health information when it is at rest and in transit. It’s applied to anybody or any system that has access (read, write, modify, or communicate) to confidential patient data. This rule includes administrative, physical and technical safeguards.

### **HIPAA Enforcement Rule**

Enforcement Rule contains the procedures that should be followed in case of a potential or alleged violation of the compliance, like a breach exposing personal health information. [Compliance violations](https://www.hipaajournal.com/hipaa-violation-fines/) can have penalties depending on the violation level of negligence, the range can be from $100 to $50,000 per violation.

### **HIPAA Omnibus Rule**

The Omnibus rule was added in 2013 to update existing rules, providing individuals new rights on their health information, and strengthening the government’s ability to enforce the HIPAA privacy and security protections.
