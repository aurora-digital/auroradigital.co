It should be easy for a psychologist to deal with this kind of situation since we know the theory, right?

It has been hard to adjust to what is happening. Everything is new for me, as well as to all of us.

  
I’m in voluntary isolation and working remotely since March 12th. Although remote work is not a new practice in our company, I didn't like to do it often..I’m a people person. I like personal and direct contact. That alone is quite a challenge, but now I’m not even allowed to be with my family or having my routine activities, like going to the gym (I’m kinda OCD about that), which are the main things that keep me sane.

I’m lucky to really enjoy being at home. I have my dog and my 50 plants (this could be a theme for a blog post too) to keep me company these days. The first days were the hardest, but as time goes by I’m getting used to this new routine.

One of the most important things, in my opinion, is to accept the fear, especially of the unknown. “How long will this last?”, “Will I be infected?” “Can I go buy groceries safely?” are natural worries and it’s ok to have them. The fear has a reason to exist. When we feel “threatened”, we become more vigilant and available to adopt protective behaviours in a way to adapt to situations that promote our safety, as well as others.

Accept that you will feel anxious. You are being “attacked” with constant information about this, and probably this is the main topic of most of your daily conversations as well. So it’s normal to feel anxious.

This was the first step for me. Allowing myself to feel things, either good or bad, and slowly trying to discover ways of coping with all this.
