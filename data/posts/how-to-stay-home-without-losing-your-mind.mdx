Almost everyone is now facing social isolation due to covid-19, so we made a list of stuff we can all do at home that can help us overcome boredom, keep your anxiety levels down and stay motivated to do things.

It's normal to feel powerless and overwhelmed, but within all this chaos, we can still find some inner peace with small tasks and some activities.

## Keep a routine

Create a new daily routine that prioritises looking after yourself. You may not feel like doing stuff you used to do, and that's ok. Do not punish yourself for not being able to be as productive as you would like to. Be kind to yourself.

## Stay in the sun

If the sun is shining, try to make the most of it! Open the windows and get sunlight several minutes a day. This will help you move, improving your daytime energy and sleep quality.

## Move your body

Find some free space in your house and do something you enjoy. Physical activity releases [brain chemicals](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/exercise#1) that will boost your mood and overall sense of well-being. Dancing, yoga, pilates, bodyweight circuits, random jumps around the house - anything works.

## Entertain yourself

Take these days as an opportunity to start the hobby you were aiming for too long. Write a journal, paint, watch movies, read books, play video games, listen to podcasts, play an instrument, do a puzzle, visit museums (online). The options are endless. To help with this, several apps, websites, games and institutions are giving content for free.

## Eat with pleasure

Food is one of the most elemental and pleasurable experiences of life, and there is nothing wrong with [eating with pleasure](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/23/opinion/sunday/emotional-eating-holidays.html) or finding comfort in it. Search for new recipes and make slower meals that require the time you never have during regular weekdays. It is also a great time to try making bread, pizza, or fresh pasta from scratch!

## Support your mental health

It's ok to feel more vulnerable, it's ok to feel lost, and it's ok to cry. We control what we can control, so focus on what you can. Avoid too much news, keep a routine, write down your emotions, keep in touch with people (by telephone, email, or social media), and seek help if you need.
