At the moment, I think everyone knows what COVID-19 Pandemic is about.

During the quarantine, we were all blasted with information via the internet and mass media. Although I have to say that the consumption and filtering employed to this information is essentially due to an instinct of survival because we wanted to understand what deprived us of our individual freedom and to safeguard our health and family. Self-didacticism was a natural act, and it only proves the sense of human evolution that is present in all of us.

Therefore, it makes no sense to explain here what COVID-19 is, which are the 2021 predictions, neither the current health measures. I think everyone is literary enough in this matter, and these questions are well-answered by reliable health sources: [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) (Internationally) and [DGS](https://covid19.min-saude.pt/) (Portugal).

COVID-19 Testing

  
Almost every news headline has been "coronavirus testing" over the past few months, which has made us research in-depth about testing.

For COVID-19, there are two kinds of tests available: viral tests and antibody tests:

* a viral test tells you whether you have a current infection;
* an antibody test might say to you if you had a past infection.
